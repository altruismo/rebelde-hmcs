# Rebelde

**Rebelde** is a response.  
To overpriced licenses.  
To closed ecosystems.  
To technological dependency.

**Rebelde** is a minimal yet powerful tool to manage clients, billing, and notifications in the hosting business. Built with **Laravel**, with a clean and open architecture from day one.

This project was born with a clear goal: to help small and medium hosting providers break free from WHMCS without sacrificing reliability or control.
